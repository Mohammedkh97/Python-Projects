## üîç Project Overview:

Your task is to **extract information from multiple PDF document types**:

* **Contracts**
* **Tourism Visas**
* **Residency documents**
* **Change Status forms**

Your goal is to **accurately detect fields** (like names, dates, etc.), but regex isn't robust due to layout variety.

## ‚úÖ Option 1: **LayoutLMv3 (Layout-Aware Model)**

### üîß How LayoutLMv3 Works:

LayoutLMv3 processes **text + layout + visual (image)** features from documents.

### üìå Pipeline Steps:

1. **PDF ‚Üí Image**
   You convert each page of the PDF into an image (e.g., using `pdf2image`).
2. **OCR on Image ‚Üí Tokens + Coordinates**
   Use **Tesseract**, **EasyOCR**, or **Azure Form Recognizer** to extract:

   * Text
   * Bounding boxes (layout)
   * Page size
3. **Label tokens** (Optional: for fine-tuning)

   * If you're training, you need to annotate fields like `NAME`, `VISA_ISSUED`, etc.
   * You usually use **FUNSD-style** or **DocLayNet-style** annotations.
4. **Feed to LayoutLMv3**
   You convert the image, bounding boxes, and token labels into a format LayoutLMv3 expects:

   ```json
   {
     "words": ["Name", ":", "Mohammed", "Khalaf"],
     "bbox": [[100, 200, 120, 220], ..., ...],
     "labels": ["O", "O", "B-NAME", "I-NAME"]
   }
   ```

### ‚úÖ Pros:

* Handles layout variability very well (e.g., contracts vs visa)
* Best for semi-structured documents like forms and government documents
* Pretrained models already exist (on IIT-CDIP, FUNSD, etc.)

### ‚ùå Cons:

* Needs conversion pipeline (PDF ‚Üí Image ‚Üí OCR)
* Requires **box-level annotations** (manual or semi-automated)
* Training is slower and requires GPUs

## ‚úÖ Option 2: **Text-based NER Model**

### üîß How It Works:

You convert PDFs to plain text (using `PyMuPDF`, `pdfminer.six`, or `pdftotext`) and apply NER (e.g., spaCy, Flair, HuggingFace transformers).

### üß† Training Data Format:

You prepare annotated training data like:

```json
{
  "text": "Name: Mohammed Khalaf\nVisa Issue Date: 2023-01-01",
  "entities": [
    [6, 22, "NAME"],
    [40, 50, "VISA_ISSUE"]
  ]
}
```

### ‚úÖ Pros:

* Easy and quick to set up
* Doesn‚Äôt need bounding boxes or OCR
* Faster training/inference time

### ‚ùå Cons:

* Loses layout info (e.g., column-based forms confuse it)
* Sensitive to document structure and format
* Struggles with scanned PDFs or low-quality OCR

## ü§î So Which One to Choose?

### üîΩ Choose **LayoutLMv3** if:

* Your documents are **scanned images**, forms, or have **important layout structure**
* You can label bounding boxes or use tools like **Label Studio** with OCR
* You have access to **GPU** for training or fine-tuning

### üîΩ Choose **Text NER** if:

* Your PDFs are **digitally generated** (not scanned) and **text extraction is clean**
* You're short on time/resources
* You can ensure consistent formatting

## üõ†Ô∏è Toolchain Recommendations

### For LayoutLMv3

* PDF to Image: `pdf2image`
* OCR: `Tesseract`, `EasyOCR`, `PaddleOCR`, or `Azure Form Recognizer`
* Labeling: `Label Studio` (export in FUNSD format)
* Model: HuggingFace's [`microsoft/layoutlmv3-base`](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/layoutlmv3-base)

### For Text-based NER

* PDF to Text: `pdfminer.six`, `PyMuPDF`
* Annotation: `doccano`, `Prodigy`
* Model: HuggingFace‚Äôs `bert-base-cased` fine-tuned for NER

---

## üì¶ Bonus: Hybrid Approach (Optional)

* Use LayoutLMv3 for **scanned & form-like docs** (Residence, Visa)
* Use Text-based NER for **contracts or clean-text PDFs**

---

If you'd like, I can:

* Show you how to prepare a sample dataset in FUNSD format
* Give you a code template to start fine-tuning LayoutLMv3
* Help you quickly test a HuggingFace NER model on your PDFs
